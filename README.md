                                      SPACE SETTLEMENTS
Prologue:
The Third World War has began, and in some years the Earth was exhausted and devastated. The remnants of humanity were forced to leave the planet and colonize other space objects. Unfortunately, the war between countries didn't stop, and people continued destroying each other on the new planets. Victory depends only on you!
Epilogue:
You did this, with the help of space and abstraction of the human war, you learned the prime, happy, Ulam numbers. Congratulations, the efforts of millions of imagined people were not in vain!

To play this game, you need to know, what is a / an:
-prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
-happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
-Ulam number is a member of an integer sequence devised by and named after Stanislaw Ulam, who introduced it in 1964. The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam sequence) starts with U1 = 1 and U2 = 2. Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all earlier terms.
