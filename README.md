# SPACE SETTLEMENT
                                      SPACE SETTLEMENT
Prologue:
The Third World War began, and in some years the planet Earth was exhausted and devastated. The remnants of humanity were forced to leave the planet and colonize other solar system patrols and, unfortunately, the war between the countries of the warring blocks did not stop, and people continued to destroy each other on the new planets. Who will win depends only on you!
Level 1:
Two crews from France and Brazil arrived in Mercury. With the help of modern technology, they were able to normalize the climate on the planet. After an extended stay and training, they enter an open confrontation near the valley with many craters. The question is one: who will soon win strategic places? 
Level 2:
Venus, the beautiful Venus, the goddess of love, which is forced to look like the last of its kind, people are destroying themselves. People from Italy and Mexico who are fighting for craters with essential resources.
Level 3:
Not all people were able to leave the planet, and the war continues here. The two most influential states, Russia and the United States, maintain their long struggle, which led to the war.
Level 4:
Mars, for decades, you wanted to colonize, fantasize, write books and film about it. And this day came. Those people did not come to you with peace, but with war. Japan and China will do everything to destroy each other on the red earth, the land of the god of war.
Level 5:
Jupiter also suffered human colonization. The struggle for such a considerable planet was reduced to the expansion of several craters. The battle between them is led by Britain and Argentina. The old reefs again tickled and only in cardinally different conditions.
Level 6:
Saturn, another giant planet on which the foot of humanity stepped in. And all that they run is just a thirst for self-destruction and thirst for wealth. Spain and India here to find out who is stronger and who will own Saturn.
Level 7:
Uranus, this is the final stop of people, further their technologies do not let fly. This object is the last planet that can be colonized. Bases are located, lids and equipment are ready. You started the capture of the craters!
Epilogue:
You did this, with the help of space and abstraction of the human war, you learned the prime, happy numbers and numbers of Ulam. Our congratulations, the efforts of millions of imagined people were not in vain!
                                              Instruction
To play our game, you need to have the following knowledge:
-A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
-A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
-An Ulam number is a member of an integer sequence devised by and named after Stanislaw Ulam, who introduced it in 1964. The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam sequence) starts with U1 = 1 and U2 = 2. Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all earlier terms.
