Prologue:
The Third World War began, and in some years the planet Earth was exhausted and devastated. The remnants of humanity were forced to leave the planet and colonize other solar system patrols and, unfortunately, the war between the countries of the warring blocks did not stop, and people continued to destroy each other on the new planets. Who will win depends only on you!
